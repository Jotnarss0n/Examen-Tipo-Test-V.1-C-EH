As a result, an attacker can perform an arbitrary Web Service request while authenticating as a legitimate user.\nWrapping attack which uses Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) signature element in order to weaken the web servers‚Äô validation requests. When a user requests for a service, it is interacted with using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and submitted in XML format. This type of attack usually occurs during the translation of SOAP messages in the Transport Layer Service (TLS) layer between the web server and valid user. The message body will be duplicated and sent to the server as a valid user. The hacker will copy the user‚Äôs account login details. During the login session, the hackers will inject a spurious element into the message structure. They will modify the original content with malicious code. After that, the message is sent to servers. The server will approve the message as the body is unchanged. As a result, the hackers will be able to access the server resources to unauthorized access.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nCloud Hopper\nhttps://www.bankinfosecurity.com/report-cloud-hopper-attacks-affected-more-msps-a-13565\nThe hacking campaign, known as ‚ÄúCloud Hopper,‚Äù was the subject of a U.S. indictment in December that accused two Chinese nationals of identity theft and fraud. Prosecutors described an elaborate operation that victimized multiple Western companies but stopped short of naming them. A Reuters report at the time identified two: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM.\n\nCloudborne\nAn attack scenario affecting various cloud providers could allow an attacker to implant persistent backdoors for data theft into bare-metal cloud servers, which would be able to remain intact as the cloud infrastructure moves from customer to customer. This opens the door to a wide array of attacks on businesses that use infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings.\nAppropriately dubbed ‚ÄúCloudborne‚Äù by Eclypsium, the attack vector (which the firm characterizes as a critical weakness) consists of the use of a known vulnerability in bare-metal hardware along with a weakness in the ‚Äúreclamation process.‚Äù\nIn the Cloudborne scenario, an attacker can first use a known vulnerability in Supermicro hardware (present in many cloud providers‚Äô infrastructure, the firm said), to overwrite the firmware of a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). BMCs are a third-party component designed to enable remote management of a server for initial provisioning, operating system reinstall and troubleshooting.\n\nSide-channel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\nA side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself (e.g. cryptanalysis and software bugs). Timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited."

No other software needs to be installed. Even though a pure honeypot is useful, a more controlled mechanism stealthiness of the defense mechanisms can be ensured.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nLow-interaction Honeypots\nA low interaction honeypot will only give an attacker minimal access to the operating system. ‚ÄòLow interaction‚Äô means precisely that the adversary will not be able to interact with your decoy system in any depth, as it is a much more static environment. A low interaction honeypot will usually emulate a small number of internet protocols and network services, just enough to deceive the attacker and no more. In general, most businesses simulate TCP and IP protocols, which allows the attacker to think they are connecting to a real system and not a honeypot environment.\nA low interaction honeypot is simple to deploy, does not give access to a real root shell, and does not use significant resources to maintain. However, a low interaction honeypot may not be effective enough, as it is only the basic simulation of a machine. It may not fool attackers into engaging, and it‚Äôs certainly not in-depth enough to capture complex threats such as zero-day exploits.\n\nHigh interaction honeypots\nA high interaction honeypot emulates certain protocols or services. The attacker is provided with real systems to attack, making it far less likely they will guess they are being diverted or observed. As the systems are only present as a decoy, any traffic that is found is by its very existence malicious, making it easy to spot threats and track and trace an attacker's behavior. Using a high interaction honeypot, researchers can learn the tools an attacker uses to escalate privileges or the lateral movements they make to attempt to uncover sensitive data.\n\nResearch honeypots\nResearch honeypots are run to gather information about the black hat community's motives and tactics targeting different networks. These honeypots do not add direct value to a specific organization; instead, they are used to research the threats that organizations face and to learn how to better protect against those threats. Research honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information and are used primarily by research, military, or government organizations."

        "explicacion": "Tunneling Virus: This virus attempts to bypass detection by antivirus scanner by installing itself in the interrupt handler chain. Interception programs, which remain in the background of an operating system and catch viruses, become disabled during the course of a tunneling virus. Similar viruses install themselves in device drivers.\n\nStealth Virus: It is a very tricky virus as it changes the code that can be used to detect it. Hence, the detection of the virus becomes very difficult. For example, it can change the read system call such that whenever the user asks to read a code modified by a virus, the original form of code is shown rather than infected code.\n\nNOTE: I don't know why EC-Council decided to combine 2 types of viruses into one. Nevertheless, on their exam, the Stealth/ tunneling virus (as in the book) is encountered on the exam, but I think the Tunneling virus is fine too.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nCavity virus\nTo avoid detection by users, some viruses employ different kinds of deception. Some old viruses, especially on the DOS platform, make sure that the \"last modified\" date of a host file stays the same when the file is infected by the virus. This approach does not fool antivirus software, however, especially those which maintain and date cyclic redundancy checks on file changes. Some viruses can infect files without increasing their sizes or damaging the files. They accomplish this by overwriting unused areas of executable files. These are called cavity viruses.\n\nPolymorphic virus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code\nPolymorphic code was the first technique that posed a serious threat to virus scanners. Just like regular encrypted viruses, a polymorphic virus infects files with an encrypted copy of itself, which is decoded by a decryption module. In the case of polymorphic viruses, however, this decryption module is also modified on each infection. A well-written polymorphic virus therefore has no parts which remain identical between infections, making it very difficult to detect directly using \"signatures\". Antivirus software can detect it by decrypting the viruses using an emulator, or by statistical pattern analysis of the encrypted virus body."

The attacker can thus work out if the message they used returned true or false, without relying on data from the database.The attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure. This method is called blind SQLi because the data is not transferred from the website database to the attacker, thus the attacker cannot see information about the attack in-band.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nError-based SQLi\nThe Error based technique, when an attacker tries to insert malicious query in input fields and get some error which is regarding SQL syntax or database.\nFor example, SQL syntax error should be like this:\nYou have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‚Äò‚ÄòVALUE‚Äô‚Äô. The error message gives information about the database used, where the syntax error occurred in the query. Error based technique is the easiest way to find SQL Injection.\n\nUNION SQLi\nWhen an application is vulnerable to SQL injection and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, the UNION keyword can be used to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This results in an SQL injection UNION attack.\nThe UNION keyword lets you execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example:\nSELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2\nThis SQL query will return a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns a and b in table1 and columns c and d in table2.\nFor a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:\n¬∑ The individual queries must return the same number of columns.\n¬∑ The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.\nTo carry out an SQL injection UNION attack, you need to ensure that your attack meets these two requirements.\n\nOut-of-band SQLi\nThe attacker can only carry out this form of attack when certain features are enabled on the database server used by the web application. This form of attack is primarily used as an alternative to the in-band and inferential SQLi techniques.\nOut-of-band SQLi is performed when the attacker can‚Äôt use the same channel to launch the attack and gather information, or when a server is too slow or unstable for these actions to be performed. These techniques count on the capacity of the server to create DNS or HTTP requests to transfer data to an attacker."

It refers to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to web developers. The HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on many web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or access to the saved cookies on the victim's computer. After successfully stealing appropriate session cookies, an adversary might use the Pass the Cookie technique to perform session hijacking. Cookie hijacking is commonly used against client authentication on the internet. Modern web browsers use cookie protection mechanisms to protect the web from being attacked.\n\nNetwork sniffing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack\nSniffing attack or a sniffer attack, in context of network security, corresponds to theft or interception of data by capturing the network traffic using a sniffer (an application aimed at capturing network packets). When data is transmitted across networks, if the data packets are not encrypted, the data within the network packet can be read using a sniffer.

Any information the infiltrator can gather on the company, such as employee names, phone numbers, and email addresses, will be vital.\nAttackers will also start to poke the network to analyze what systems and hosts are there. They will note any changes in the system that can be used as an entrance point. For example, leaving your network open for a vendor to fix an issue can also allow the cybercriminal to plant himself inside.\nBy the end of this pre-attack phase, attackers will have created a detailed map of the network, highlighted the system‚Äôs weaknesses, and continued with their mission.

With an increase in employees working from home or using their personal devices for work, there is an increase in data breaches.\nNOTE: Reconnaissance takes place in two parts ‚àí Active Reconnaissance and Passive Reconnaissance. And again, the problem of the question is in the levels of abstraction. It can be difficult to choose one correct option if it is part of something larger. Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning & Enumeration) to discover and collect information about a target system covertly. \"Footprinting\" would have been more correct."

        "explicacion": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking\nClickjacking is an attack that tricks a user into clicking a webpage element which is invisible or disguised as another element. This can cause users to unwittingly download malware, visit malicious web pages, provide credentials or sensitive information, transfer money, or purchase products online.\nTypically, clickjacking is performed by displaying an invisible page or HTML element, inside an iframe, on top of the page the user sees. The user believes they are clicking the visible page but in fact they are clicking an invisible element in the additional page transposed on top of it.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nSession Fixation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation\nSession fixation is a web application attack in which attackers can trick a victim into authenticating the application using the attacker's Session Identifier. Unlike Session Hijacking, this does not rely on stealing the Session ID of an already authenticated user.\nA simple way attacker can send a link containing a fixed session-id, and if the victim clicks on the link, the victim‚Äôs session id will be fixed since the attacker already know the session id so he/she can easily hijack the session.\n\nHTML Injection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection\nThe essence of this type of injection attack is injecting HTML code through the website's vulnerable parts. The Malicious user sends HTML code through any vulnerable field to change the website‚Äôs design or any information displayed to the user.\nAs a result, the user may see the data the malicious user sent. Therefore, in general, HTML Injection is just the injection of markup language code to the page's document.\nData that is being sent during this type of injection attack may be very different. It can be a few HTML tags that will display the sent information. Also, it can be the whole fake form or page. When this attack occurs, the browser usually interprets malicious user data as legit and displays it.\nChanging a website‚Äôs appearance is not the only risk that this type of attack brings. It is quite similar to the XSS attack, where the malicious user steals other person‚Äôs identities.\nTherefore stealing another person‚Äôs identity may also happen during this injection attack.\n\nHTTP Parameter Pollution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_parameter_pollution\nHTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is a vulnerability that occurs due to the passing of multiple parameters having the same name. There is no RFC standard on what should be done when passed multiple parameters. For example, if the parameter username is included in the GET or POST parameters twice.\nSupplying multiple HTTP parameters with the same name may cause an application to interpret values in unanticipated ways. By exploiting these effects, an attacker may bypass input validation, trigger application errors, or modify internal variables values. As HTTP Parameter Pollution affects a building block of all web technologies, server and client-side attacks exist.\nIn 2009, immediately after the publication of the first research on HTTP Parameter Pollution, the technique received attention from the security community as a possible way to bypass web application firewalls."

        "respuesta": "B",
        "explicacion": "The area most open to attack is often the routing systems within your enterprise network. Because of some of the sniffing-based attacks, an enterprise routing infrastructure can easily be attacked with man-in-the-middle and other attacks designed to corrupt or change the routing tables with the following results:\n¬∑ Traffic redirection‚Äî enabling the attacker to modify traffic in transit or sniff packets;\n¬∑ Traffic sent to a routing black hole‚Äî the attacker can send specific routes to null0, effectively kicking IP addresses off the network;\n¬∑ Router denial-of-service (DoS)‚Äîattacking the routing process can crash the router or severe service degradation;\n¬∑ Routing protocol DoS‚ÄîSimilar to the attack previously described against a whole router, a routing protocol attack could be launched to stop the routing process from functioning properly;\n¬∑ Unauthorized route prefix origination‚Äîthis attack aims to introduce a new prefix into the routing table that shouldn't be there. The attacker might do this to get a covert attack network to be routable throughout the victim network.\nThere are four primary attack methods for these attacks:\n¬∑ Configuration modification of existing routers;\n¬∑ Introduction of a rogue router that participates in routing with legitimate routers;\n¬∑ Spoofing a valid routing protocol message or modifying a valid message in transit;\n¬∑ Sending of malformed or excess packets to a routing protocol process.\nThese four attack methods can be mitigated in the following ways:\n¬∑ To counter configuration modification of existing routers, you must secure the routers. This includes not only the configuration of the router but also the supporting systems it makes use of, such as TFTP servers.\n¬∑ Anyone can attempt to introduce a rogue router, but to cause damage, the attacker needs the other routing devices to believe the sent information. This can most easily be blocked by adding message authentication to your routing protocol. Additionally, the routing protocol message types can be blocked by ACLs from networks with no need to originate them.\n¬∑ Message authentication can also help prevent the spoofing or modification of a valid routing protocol message. Besides, the transport layer protocol (such as TCP for BGP) can further complicate message spoofing because of the difficulty in guessing pseudo-random initial sequence numbers (assuming a remote attacker).\n¬∑ Excess packets can be stopped through the use of traditional DoS mitigation techniques. Malformed packets, however, are nearly impossible to stop without the participation of the router vendor. Only through exhaustive testing and years of field use do routing protocol implementations correctly deal with most malformed messages. This is an area of computer security that needs increased attention, not just in routing protocols but in all network applications."

Reviewing a company‚Äôs website is an example of passive footprinting, whereas attempting to gain access to sensitive information through social engineering is an example of active information gathering. Footprinting is basically the first step where hacker gathers as much information as possible to find ways to intrude into a target system or at least decide what type of attacks will be more suitable for the target.\nDuring this phase, a hacker can collect the following information:\n¬∑ Domain name\n¬∑ IP Addresses\n¬∑ Namespaces\n¬∑ Employee information\n¬∑ Phone numbers\n¬∑ E-mails\n¬∑ Job Information\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nScanning\nSecurity scanning can mean many different things, but it can be described as scanning a website's security, web-based program, network, or file system for either vulnerabilities or unwanted file changes. The type of security scanning required for a particular system depends on what that system is used. The more complicated and intricate the system or network is, the more in-depth the security scan has. Security scanning can be done as a one-time check, but most companies who incorporate this into their security practices buy a service that continually scans their systems and networks.\nOne of the more popular open-source software platforms that run security scans is called Nmap. It has been around for a very long time and has the ability to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a network. Several online scans are available; however, these come with varying degrees of effectiveness and cost-efficiency.\nNOTE: In the context of an EC-Council course and exam, think of these definitions like this:\nFootprinting is a passive collection of information without touching the target system/network/computer.\nScanning is an active collection of information associated with a direct impact on the target.\nYes, that's not entirely true, but this course has big problems with abstraction levels.

The same can be used to exploit the system further.

        "explicacion": "Slowloris is a type of denial of service attack tool which allows a single machine to take down another machine's web server with minimal bandwidth and side effects on unrelated services and ports.\nSlowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible. It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request. Periodically, it will send subsequent HTTP headers, adding to, but never completed, the request. Affected servers will keep these connections open, filling their maximum concurrent connection pool, eventually denying additional connection attempts from clients.\nThe program was named after Slow lorises, a group of primates that are known for their slow movement.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nHTTP GET/POST (HTTP Flood) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Flood\nHTTP Flood is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in which the attacker manipulates HTTP and POST unwanted requests in order to attack a web server or application. These attacks often use interconnected computers that have been taken over with the aid of malware such as Trojan Horses. Instead of using malformed packets, spoofing and reflection techniques, HTTP floods require less bandwidth to attack the targeted sites or servers.\n\nSpoofed Session Flood\nFake Session attacks try to bypass security under the disguise of a valid TCP session by carrying an SYN, multiple ACK and one or more RST or FIN packets. This attack can bypass defence mechanisms that are only monitoring incoming traffic on the network. These DDoS attacks can also exhaust the target‚Äôs resources and result in a complete system shutdown or unacceptable system performance.\n\nFragmentation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation_attack\nIP fragmentation attacks are a kind of computer security attack based on how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires data to be transmitted and processed. Specifically, it invokes IP fragmentation, a process used to partition messages (the service data unit (SDU); typically a packet) from one layer of a network into multiple smaller payloads that can fit within the lower layer's protocol data unit (PDU). Every network link has a maximum size of messages that may be transmitted, called the maximum transmission unit (MTU). If the SDU plus metadata added at the link-layer exceeds the MTU, the SDU must be fragmented. IP fragmentation attacks exploit this process as an attack vector.\nPart of the TCP/IP suite is the Internet Protocol (IP) which resides at the Internet Layer of this model. IP is responsible for the transmission of packets between network endpoints. IP includes some features which provide basic measures of fault-tolerance (time to live, checksum), traffic prioritization (a type of service) and support for the fragmentation of larger packets into multiple smaller packets (ID field, fragment offset). The support for fragmentation of larger packets provides a protocol allowing routers to fragment a packet into smaller packets when the original packet is too large for the supporting datalink frames. IP fragmentation exploits (attacks) use the fragmentation protocol within IP as an attack vector."

        "explicacion": "There is a social engineering technique \"baiting\" that exploits the human‚Äôs curiosity. Baiting is sometimes confused with other social engineering attacks. Its main characteristic is the promise of goods that hackers use to deceive the victims.\nA classic example is an attack scenario in which attackers use a malicious file disguised as a software update or generic software. An attacker can also power a baiting attack in the physical world, such as disseminating infected USB tokens in the parking lot of a target organization and waiting for internal personnel to insert them into corporate PCs.\nThe malware installed on the USB tokens will compromise the PCs, gaining the full control needed for the attacks.\nA quid pro quo attack (aka ‚Äúsomething for something‚Äù attack) is a variant of baiting. Instead of baiting a target with the promise of a good, a quid pro quo attack promises a service or a benefit based on a specific action's execution.\nIn a quid pro quo attack scenario, the hacker offers a service or benefit in exchange for information or access.\nThe most common quid pro quo attack occurs when a hacker impersonates an IT staffer for a large organization. That hacker attempts to contact the target organization's employees via phone and then offers them some upgrade or software installation.\nThey might request victims to facilitate the operation by disabling the AV software temporarily to install the malicious application.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nReverse Social Engineering\nReverse Social Engineering (RSE) is a form of social engineering attack. It has the same aim as a typical social engineering attack but with a completely different approach. This is a person-to-person attack in which an attacker convinces the target that he or she has a problem or might have a certain problem in the future and that he, the attacker, is ready to help solve the problem.\nFor example, the hacker establishes contact with the target through e-mail or other social media platforms, using multiple schemes and pretending to be a benefactor or skilled security personnel to convince them to provide access to their system/network. Though this technique may seem outdated and ridiculous, it has proved highly effective, especially when the victim's system/network shows signs of being compromised. Usually, in social engineering attacks, the attackers approach their targets. While in a reverse social engineering attack, the victim goes to the attacker unknowingly.\n\nTailgating\nTailgating, sometimes referred to as piggybacking, is a physical security breach in which an unauthorized person follows an authorized individual to enter a secured premise.\nTailgating provides a simple social engineering-based way around many security mechanisms one would think of as secure. Even retina scanners don't help if an employee holds the door for an unknown person behind them out of misguided courtesy.\nPeople who might tailgate include disgruntled former employees, thieves, vandals, mischiefmakers, and issues with employees or the company. Any of these can disrupt business, cause damage, create unexpected costs, and lead to further safety issues.\n\nElicitation\nElicitation means to bring or draw out or arrive at a conclusion (truth, for instance) by logic. Alternatively, it is defined as stimulation that calls up (or draws forth) a particular class of behaviors, as in \"the elicitation of his testimony was not easy.\"\nIn training materials, the National Security Agency of the United States government defines elicitation as \"the subtle extraction of information during an apparently normal and innocent conversation.\"\nThese conversations can occur anywhere that the target is‚Äîa restaurant, the gym, a daycare‚Äîanywhere. Elicitation works well because it is low risk and often very hard to detect. Most of the time, the targets don't ever know where the information"

        "explicacion": "Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web-based applications running either locally in the browser or on a third-party server. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients.\nIRC is a plaintext protocol that is officially assigned port 194, according to IANA. However, running the service on this port requires running it with root-level permissions, which is inadvisable. As a result, the well-known port for IRC is 6667, a high-number port that does not require elevated privileges. However, an IRC server can also be configured to run on other ports as well.\nYou can't tell if an IRC server is designed to be malicious solely based on port number. Still, if you see an IRC server running on port a WKP such as 80, 8080, 53, 443, it's almost always going to be malicious; the only real reason for IRCD to be running on port 80 is to try to evade firewalls.\n\nAn application firewall is a form of firewall that controls input/output or system calls of an application or service. It operates by monitoring and blocking communications based on a configured policy, generally with predefined rule sets to choose from. The application firewall can control communications up to the OSI model's application layer, which is the highest operating layer, and where it gets its name. The two primary categories of application firewalls are network-based and host-based.\nApplication layer filtering operates at a higher level than traditional security appliances. This allows packet decisions to be made based on more than just source/destination IP Addresses or ports. It can also use information spanning across multiple connections for any given host.\n\nNetwork-based application firewalls\nNetwork-based application firewalls operate at the application layer of a TCP/IP stack. They can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non-standard port or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused.\n\nHost-based application firewalls\nA host-based application firewall monitors application system calls or other general system communication. This gives more granularity and control but is limited to only protecting the host it is running on. Control is applied by filtering on a per-process basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. Further filtering can be done by examining the process ID of the owner of the data packets. Many host-based application firewalls are combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter."

In this issue, we consider the non-persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability.\nThe non-persistent (or reflected) cross-site scripting vulnerability is by far the most basic type of web vulnerability. These holes show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the content.\nBecause HTML documents have a flat, serial structure that mixes control statements, formatting, and the actual content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A classic example of a potential vector is a site search engine: if one searches for a string, the search string will typically be redisplayed verbatim on the result page to indicate what was searched for. If this response does not properly escape or reject HTML control characters, a crosssite scripting flaw will ensue.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nWebsite defacement vulnerability\nWebsite defacements are the unauthorized modification of web pages, including the addition, removal, or alteration of existing content. These attacks are commonly carried out by hacktivists, who compromise a website or web server and replace or alter the hosted website information with their own messages.\n\nSQL injection vulnerability https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\nSQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.\n\nCross-site Request Forgery vulnerability https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosssite_request_forgery\nCross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests, for example, can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser."

        "explicacion": "Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts. There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript XMLHttpRequests, for example, can all work without the user's interaction or even knowledge. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.\nIn a CSRF attack, an innocent end-user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a web request that they did not intend. This may cause actions to be performed on the website that can include inadvertent client or server data leakage, change of session state, or manipulation of an end user's account.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nCommand Injection Attacks\nCommand injection is an attack in which the goal is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to a system shell.\n\nFile Inclusion Attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_inclusion_vulnerability\nA file inclusion vulnerability is a type of web vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic directory traversal attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application. An attacker can use remote code execution to create a web shell on the web server, which can be used for website defacement.\n\nHidden Field Manipulation Attack\nManipulating Hidden Fields: An adversary exploits a weakness in the server's trust of client-side processing by modifying data on the client-side, such as price information, and then submitting this data to the server, which processes the modified data. For example, eShoplifting is a data manipulation attack against an on-line merchant during a purchasing transaction. The manipulation of price, discount or quantity fields in the transaction message allows the adversary to acquire items at a lower cost than the merchant intended. The adversary performs a normal purchasing transaction but edits hidden fields within the HTML form response that store price or other information to give themselves a better deal. The merchant then uses the modified pricing information in calculating the cost of the selected items."

The error message gives information about the database used, where the syntax error occurred in the query.\nError based technique is the easiest way to find SQL Injection.\n\nUNION SQLi\nWhen an application is vulnerable to SQL injection and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, the UNION keyword can be used to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This results in an SQL injection UNION attack.\nThe UNION keyword lets you execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example:\nSELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2\nThis SQL query will return a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns a and b in table1 and columns c and d in table2.\nFor a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:\n¬∑ The individual queries must return the same number of columns.\n¬∑ The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.\nTo carry out an SQL injection UNION attack, you need to ensure that your attack meets these two requirements.\n\nEnd-of-Line Comment\nAfter injecting code into a particular field, legitimate code that follows if nullified through the usage of end of line comments: SELECT * FROM user WHERE name = 'x' AND userid IS NULL; --';"

Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.\nIn a CSRF attack, an innocent end user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a web request that they did not intend. This may cause actions to be performed on the website that can include inadvertent client or server data leakage, change of session state, or manipulation of an end user's account.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nCross-site scripting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec up until 2007. XSS effects vary in range from a petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner network.\n\nSession hijacking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking\nSession hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking is the exploitation of a valid computer session‚Äîsometimes also called a session key‚Äîto gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to web developers, as the HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on many web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim's computer (see HTTP cookie theft). After successfully stealing appropriate session cookies an adversary might use the Pass the Cookie technique to perform session hijacking. Cookie hijacking is commonly used against client authentication on the internet. Modern web browsers use cookie protection mechanisms to protect the web from being attacked.\n\nSQL injection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\nSQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database."
